My name is Ayisha Jilani and I am a student at the University of Toronto currently majoring in Political Science and Public Law. I am an aspiring future lawyer and have always known I wanted to pursue a career in the legal field for as long as I can remember. \n<br/><br/>\nDuring the pandemic, I found it incredibly difficult to find opportunities that helped me gain exposure to the legal profession and was seriously doubting what I wanted to do after my undergrad. One night, I was talking to a friend about how I wish there was a platform for students like myself to network with legal professionals, a way for us to shadow with lawyers, for example, and find out more about what a day in their career looks like. \n<br/><br/>\nSuddenly it hit me, there was clearly an opening for an organization of this kind and I knew I was not the only one struggling to find something like this. With the help of support and encouragement from friends and family, I stepped out of my comfort zone and took a leap of faith. That is how Pre-Law Shadowers came to be!\n<br/><br/>\nI remember worrying about how this would all work out and whether people would be interested or not. Months later, I can confidently say that Pre-Law Shadowers has exceeded my expectations and rapidly grown to where it is today. We have also hired an amazing team of dedicated individuals, who I am very proud to be working with. \n<br/><br/>\nI hope you become a part of the Pre-Law Shadowers community, and that we can help you with your future academic journey. \n<br/><br/>\nSincerely,\n<br/><br/>\nAyisha Jilani","frontmatter":{"title":"About | Pre-Law Shadowers","profile_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAcABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBQECBv/EABcBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwT/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAZD1BrRpTRbxsnsvzmhYf//EABsQAAMAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRITEy/9oACAEBAAEFAlIkaLelxOYqqou95FSZm99s/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBEBP/2gAIAQMBAT8BpVhjM//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8BH//EABwQAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBEAEiAhQf/aAAgBAQAGPwLAJHQ0Kq4ah1N//8QAGRABAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARQSFR/9oACAEBAAE/Ia8Jgv7nNhzAOVk6fT0LlzGQIiO2u+weq+X/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEEM6gf/EABsRAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERABAhQXGx/9oACAEDAQE/EEw6WwYI4TN5/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABExASH/2gAIAQIBAT8QmoRejP/EABwQAQEBAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQWGx0f/aAAgBAQABPxCKcwnjdcnJtKfKy446lEynj36g5FxDhLBzn7wJXg33h/cBcFo3IQIgk+dwUFkD8cuSiqUPHf/Z"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/fd8c92483a9d7e4969d64c9f02e48a7a/d118a/ayisha-jilani.png","srcSet":"/static/fd8c92483a9d7e4969d64c9f02e48a7a/45cbc/ayisha-jilani.png 60w,\n/static/fd8c92483a9d7e4969d64c9f02e48a7a/0e06d/ayisha-jilani.png 120w,\n/static/fd8c92483a9d7e4969d64c9f02e48a7a/d118a/ayisha-jilani.png 240w","sizes":"(min-width: 240px) 240px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":240,"height":335}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
