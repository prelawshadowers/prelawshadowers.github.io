Whether we develop these preconceived notions from TV or in books and movies, we all have an idea of what to expect before entering law school. However, if you research and talk to individuals who are in law school, it will become apparent that what we think we know is not true. Here are the top myths about law school you should know aren’t completely true.</p>\n<p>Firstly, one of the biggest myths about law school is that it consists of nonstop work and there is no time for a social life or ‘play’ (1). While most of your law school career can be spent studying, the key to having both work and play is balance. According to Mary Frenson of ‘Ms. JD’, “You’ll have an opportunity to blossom socially, and make friendships that will last for years, and make connections you can use when you become a lawyer” (2). Finding a balance will prove to be difficult initially, but once you slowly progress through school, you will find a balance that works for you. Thus, despite popular belief and what is shown in the media law school can be both a place of education and networking if you identify which priorities are most important (1).</p>\n<p>Secondly, it has also been said that law school can be a very elitist and competitive environment with how hard it is to get in (1). Law school is competitive no matter where you go, and competition does exist in law-related competitions (1). Since competition will not and cannot be avoided, competition in law school can actually be good in some ways. Competition tends to bring out the best in students and when you are surrounded by people with goals similar to yours, you will be pushed to work your hardest to be the best at those goals (1). According to The Lawyer Portal, “a proper appreciation of law school should transcend mere competition” (1). There is a difference between healthy and unhealthy competition. You can decide which is which by if the competition is to improve one’s skills or merely being competitive for no particular reason (2). Further, it is also a common misconception that law school can be elitist, however, law school is made of all kinds of people and personalities. Law schools generally accept students based on merit instead of any other discriminatory criteria, such as LSAT scores and average GPA (1). Thus, it accepts students of all socioeconomic statuses and ethnic backgrounds from around the world (1).</p>\n<p>Lastly, from afar and through the media law school can come off as “too intense and pointless”. You are given loads of readings, deadlines and obligations to fulfil. There is no doubt that law school is demanding and requires hard work, but every type of school requires hard work from individuals. Spoken from law students from The Lawyer Portal, law school is a humbling but amazing journey (1). Going through all the hard work and obstacles in your journey, you gain the experience to stand on your own two feet and skills for life (1). You learn to find solutions rather than be overturned by obstacles in your way. It may be difficult to cope with initially, but it will become more manageable as time goes by (1).</p>\n<p>As you can see, I have only named a few of the many misconceptions people have about law school. I hope reading this took away some stress you may be feeling about going to law school. The important thing to note here is to never give up. As any situation goes, things may not go your way in the beginning, but as time goes by you will find your way and what works for you.</p>\n<h3>Endnotes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Ford, Isabella. “5 Biggest Myths About Law School.” The Lawyer Portal, July 3, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/myths-law-school/\">https://www.thelawyerportal.com/blog/myths-law-school/</a>.</li>\n<li>Frenson, Mary. “9 myths about law school.” Ms. JD, February 5, 2017. <a href=\"https://ms-jd.org/blog/article/9-myths-about-law-school\">https://ms-jd.org/blog/article/9-myths-about-law-school</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Author</h3>\n<p>Anjali Kupchand</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debunking Myths about Law School","tags":["editorial"],"date":"August 24, 2021","author":"Anjali Kupchand","description":"We often see a characterized depiction of what a law school will be like.
