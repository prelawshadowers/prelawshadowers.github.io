Although some students might take pride in their ability to manage their time and workload efficiently, the pressure of law school is completely different from the type one faces in university (4). The drastic change can cause a lot of people discontinue the law journey due to their inability to cope.</p>\n<p>Generally, pursuing higher education comes with the increase of ‘workaholic’ culture, in which people forget to prioritize self-care and work themselves too hard (5). The culture may start when individuals are still in university since students are already subjected to the immeasurable stress of studying for the LSAT, ensuring they have a GPA which stands out, working on their applications and applying to various law schools. However, stress levels spike once a person finally begins attending law school.</p>\n<p>The teaching method is different from other educational institutions. Most professors use the Socratic method in which a person is picked from a crowd of students and asked rapid fire questions (7). This technique tends to be intimidating since an individual is much more vulnerable in front of an audience, as opposed to writing a test in an examination hall. It is much more aggressive and has been one of the reasons why a lot of law students feel on edge and incredibly stressed (7). An individual’s mental health can deteriorate due to the constant elevated stress levels, which can lead to anxiety, depression, or other mental health disorders.</p>\n<p>The Socratic method of teaching makes concepts a lot more difficult to grasp since students have been conditioned to study differently in earlier stages of their academic career. In university, people are tested through their ability to memorise general concepts and apply critical thinking skills to form solutions. Contrastingly, law schools utilize didactic teaching methods, where memorization plays an insignificant role (2). The Socratic method is commonly used by law professors to engage with students by having one on one conversations to test their knowledge. It requires one to obtain extensive knowledge on certain topics while possessing a logical and practical understanding of complex situations. Since they are unfamiliar with the teaching method, first year law students can feel overwhelmed by having to figure out their new technique of studying and simultaneously being bombarded with more work.</p>\n<p>Managing relationships outside of school also becomes a major challenge faced by students going into law school. Friends, family members, and partners may feel ignored or neglected since students do not possessive a lot of free time dedicated towards managing their social life (1). Law schools are notorious in creating unmatched levels of stress for their students, which can leave them and the members of their social circle, feeling lonely. For parents, it may seem like their children have no interest in taking time out for them, even though in reality students are simply battling the stress of school. Professor Lydia Bleasdale from University of Leeds found that law students have very little free time to pursue relationships and even activities unrelated to the profession, unlike their cohorts. In fact, most activities which law students engage in outside of studying, is likely to be connected to the field of law (5).</p>\n<p>Another reason why law school comes with its own level of stress is the way students are not given a lot of opportunities to do well. During undergrad, students are given several opportunities throughout the year to boost or make up grades through midterm tests, assignments, essays, and final exams. Contrastingly, law school presents only one or two opportunities to grade students, which illustrates how high the stakes are as it leaves little room for error (5).</p>\n<p>Additionally, the sense of competition increases the anxiety which a lot of students face since everyone around you poses as a rival. Undergrad has thousands of people, all of whom are enrolled in different programs with different focuses and goals. Contrastingly, in law school, limited enrolment of students grants entry to a small pool of candidates, and everyone has one goal, to be work for a prestigious law firm while standing out from the rest. Although the sense of competition can be used as motivation to help some reach their full potential, for others it can take a negative toll on their mental health (3)</p>\n<p>A study found that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>students were comparing themselves to others and then feeling deficient, like they were the only ones who didn’t understand something or were the only ones who were struggling. It was usually related to a sense of not being good enough academically (5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Enabling the toxic culture of comparison actively lowers people’s self-esteem and may lead individuals to indulge in unhealthy habits. Research has shown that addiction in the legal profession stems from law school where people feel the pressure to compete and eventually resort to drugs and alcohol to cope (6). A wide variety of drugs, especially cocaine, are used to keep overworked students alert to prevent them from falling behind or losing precious time through sleep.</p>\n<p>Although the cut-throat competition can make one feel isolated, it is essential to realize everyone is in the same boat, especially in the first year of law school. All students are bound to struggle, and no one should feel ashamed for feeling stressed or seeking professional help. To ease into the lifestyle and stressful conditions of law schools, students are encouraged to take part in pre-law societies and similar organizations to take part in conversations related to law with like-minded people (4). It allows an individual to candidly talk to like-minded people and make friends with those who have similar goals and interest. Some law societies also connect you to current and former law students in informal settings, which can go a far way in helping students in seeking opportunities in the future. Given the way law school is isolating from one’s family and friends, making connections through such extracurricular clubs with people who are undergoing similar circumstances serves to help one feel heard and understood.</p>\n<h3>Endnotes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>CDTALaw, “Family, Stress and 1Ls” California Desert Trial Academy College of Law, February 24, 2021. <a href=\"https://cdtalaw.com/cdta/family-stress-1ls/\">https://cdtalaw.com/cdta/family-stress-1ls/</a></li>\n<li>“How Hard is Law School? 5 Differences Between Law School and Undergrad”, University of Buffalo School of Law, August 6, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.law.buffalo.edu/blog/5_differences_between_law_school_and_undergrad.html\">https://www.law.buffalo.edu/blog/5_differences_between_law_school_and_undergrad.html</a></li>\n<li>“How to Deal with Law School Stress in Healthy Ways.” New England Law Boston. <a href=\"https://www.nesl.edu/blog/detail/how-to-deal-with-law-school-stress-in-healthy-ways\">https://www.nesl.edu/blog/detail/how-to-deal-with-law-school-stress-in-healthy-ways</a></li>\n<li>Joanna Hughes, “Four Tips for Transitioning from College to Law School” Keystone Law, January 3, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.lawstudies.com/article/four-tips-for-transitioning-from-college-to-law-school/\">https://www.lawstudies.com/article/four-tips-for-transitioning-from-college-to-law-school/</a></li>\n<li>Matthew Jenkin, “Legally drained: why are stress levels rising among law students?” The Guardian, November 19, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/19/legally-drained-why-are-stress-levels-rising-among-law-students\">https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/19/legally-drained-why-are-stress-levels-rising-among-law-students</a></li>\n<li>NYC, Psychiatry. “The Severity of Drug Addiction in the Legal Profession.” Fifth Avenue Psychiatry, April 23, 2019. <a href=\"https://www.psychiatrynyc.com/blog/the-severity-of-drug-addiction-in-lawyers/\">https://www.psychiatrynyc.com/blog/the-severity-of-drug-addiction-in-lawyers/</a></li>\n<li>Roger Whittler, “Managing stress in law school and beyond”, The Missouri Bar, November 18, 2020. <a href=\"https://news.mobar.org/managing-stress-in-law-school-and-beyond/\">https://news.mobar.org/managing-stress-in-law-school-and-beyond/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Author</h3>\n<p>Myra Mansoor</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Transition from University to 1L","tags":["editorial"],"date":"June 06, 2021","author":"Myra Mansoor","description":"The transition from studying at university to attending first year of law school tends to take a massive toll on people’s lifestyle and mental health.","social_image":{"absolutePath":"/Users/savanmalhotra/Sites/pls/gatsby-starter-glass/static/media/blog/the-transition-from-university-to-1L.jpg"}}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Racist Undertones and the Secrecy of Law Firms on Bay Street"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/racist-undertones-and-the-secrecy-of-law-firms-on-bay-street/"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/the-transition-from-university-to-1L/","prevSlug":"/blog/racist-undertones-and-the-secrecy-of-law-firms-on-bay-street/","nextSlug":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
